This is a project to make avaiable the datasets from a book as an R package. Read the files here, but
particularly the file `CASI-data.R` which I used to download the datasets. I've done that, using the script
`data-raw/CASI-save.R`, so all the datasets are now in `data/`. What I need is to create a roxygen documentation
file of all those datasets, in `R/data.R`. You have permission to read anything here. You can start with a few to
see if there are problems with this.
